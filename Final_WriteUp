Introduction
Paper Replication: ​Does Skin Tone Matter? Immigrant Mobility in the U.S. Labor Market
In this project, we replicate a study by Johee Han of the effect of skin tone on immigrant mobility in the United States. Using a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression model and panel data on immigrants’ occupational achievements over time, we find that dark-skinned immigrants face sharper downward mobility upon arrival to the US and slower later upward mobility compared to light-skinned immigrants, controlling for race/ethnicity, country of origin, human and social capital (education, english fluency), visa type, and demographics.
The main challenges we encountered included matching data from our primary data source, the New Immigrant Survey, with a separate index of occupational metrics that the original author used as his dependent variable; we ultimately figured out how to do this using matching census codes. The author’s lack of specificity in how he constructed his dataset made replicating his exact results too difficult. We do not know exactly which NIS questions he referred to and had trouble tracking down explanations of which variables he dropped, as examples. Below we summarize the paper itself, explain the data sources, and present our regression results.
Paper Summary
This paper discusses the impact of skin tone on immigrant mobility. The author uses the New Immigrant Survey (NIS) from 2003 to examine how skin tone affects immigrants’ occupational achievements. Past studies have found negative labor market effects associated with having a darker skin tone (Figure below, though it doesn’t include 0, which indicates lightest possible tone). While those studies captured one period in time, Han aims to measure the effect of skin tone on immigrant mobility over time. The three time periods examined are: the last job held abroad, the first job held in the United States, and the current job in the United States. The paper tests two hypotheses. First, that immigrants with a darker skin tone will experience steeper downward mobility at arrival to the United States net of race. Second, that immigrants with a darker skin tone will experience less steep upward trajectories post-immigration net of race and other controls.
  1.
The data used is the NIS in addition to the International Socio-Economic Index (ISEI) of 2008. The NIS is an in-depth survey of immigrant experiences and demographics. The ISEI is a standardized scale of occupations which presents a weighted metric based on mean education and income in each occupation. The purpose of using the ISEI index instead of wage/earnings variables is because some countries of origin in the NIS are grouped into regions, preventing us from adjusting wages from jobs abroad into comparable US wages. Han also prefers the ISEI because its inclusion of education level in addition to wages allows us to capture one's socioeconomic status, which may be more stable over time than their income. The NIS data includes a measure of skin tone ranging from 1 to 10 (10 being the darkest), determined by the interviewer.
The study uses occupational status over time as the dependent variable in the regressions. Han narrowed his analysis to participants that had a recorded skin tone and were employed for all 3 periods studied. He controlled for self-identified demographics of race, gender and age, human/social/cultural capital, visa type, country of origin, U.S. experiences, and regions of U.S. residence and missing data on race/ethnicity in different models to avoid bias. He uses a Generalized Least Squares model (GLS) with random-effects in order to analyze the effects of skin tone on occupation. We have decided to replicate the first model in the paper, which is a random effects model.
Model Equation: yit = (μt + αi) + βSkinTonei + γTime2i +δTime3i + ηSkinTone * Time2i + θSkinTone * Time3i + λXi + εit
From this model, Han found that immigrants with a darker skin tone are predicted to have a lower occupational status at all three time points.
Data
As noted above, the data we used comes from the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), a panel study of new legal immigrants and their children to the United States compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The cohort used in this study sampled immigrants from May to November of 2003. We acquired the data through Princeton University’s Office of Population Research online portal. The second data source we used was the ISEI, explained briefly above, which gives various occupations a numeric rank based on standardized metrics of education and income across countries (Ganzeboom 2010).

 Our raw NIS data included, from the adult sample: Section A for demographics and US region, Section B for pre-immigration experiences (including the first and last job abroad and the first job in the US), Section C for current employment, Section N for ethnicity values, and Section R for skin tones. These were merged into a single dataset, and the occupational values from the three time periods were matched with the appropriate ISEI codes. We dropped observations missing a skin tone as well as observations missing all three of the occupation observations. We dropped country of birth because it would have been too tedious to encode. For missing observations of the last job held before immigration, we included observations for the first job held before immigration, as this is what the original study did.

With a skin tone of zero (i.e. the palest option), an individual’s ISEI score is expected to be 51.62 for their last job before immigrating to the United States. For every increase of 1 on the skin tone scale, ISEI score is expected to decrease by 0.817 points keeping job_number constant. Finally, on average, an individual’s last job abroad (job_number = 1) is expected to have a ISEI score 16.29 points higher than their first job in the US, and 12.29 points higher than their current job in the US. All of the coefficients are statistically significant.
Regression 3 uses the full regression from the original model, as shown below, with various demographic, education, language, immigration status control variables.

The job number and skin tone results follow the same trend as in regression 1, as skin tone is negatively correlated with ISEI score, and both jobs are negatively correlated with ISEI score in comparison to Job 1, with Job 3 faring slightly higher than Job 2. However, skin_tone is not statistically significant in this case.
Both the job_number/skin_tone interaction terms are positive, indicating that increasing values/darker skin tones increases the significance of the effect of T2 on ISEI score (For instance, holding all other variables constant, someone with darker skin is more likely to see a larger change in ISEI score from Job 1 to Job 2. Whether that change is positive or negative remains to be seen). Overall, holding all other variables constant there is a marked decrease in ISEI score of 17.59 points from job 1 to job 2, with job 3 faring roughly 3.2 points better than job 2 in comparison to job 1. This trend was statistically significant for Job 3, but not Job 2.
Holding all other variables constant, the control variables can be interpreted as follows:

 Those with visa sponsorship are expected to have ISEI scores 3.03 points above those without. Of those whose visas were sponsored, those that were jointly sponsored are expected to have ISEI scores an additional 0.77 points above those whose visas were not jointly sponsored. (Neither statistically significant)
If the primary language of the interview was Spanish, as opposed to English (the only options offered by the CAPI software program), their ISEI scores were expected to be overall 3.88 points lower than those interviewed in English. (Statistically significant)
For every additional year of education an individual has received, the ISEI scores of their jobs was on average 1.42 points higher than an individual with one fewer year. For every year of education in the United States, individuals were expected to have ISEI scores 0.47 points higher than someone with one fewer year of education in the US. (Both statistically significant)
As age increases by 1 year, expected ISEI score increases by 0.0035 points (this is not statistically significant.)
Women were expected to have ISEI scores 2.75 points lower than their male peers. (significant)
The region variables indicated change in expected ISEI scores with respect to an individual whose region of residence was not reported. In comparing across regions, it is expected that holding other variables constant, an individual in the West would have ISEI scores 2.37 points lower than someone in the South, 0.12 points lower than someone in the Northeast, and 0.81 points lower than someone in the Midwest.
V ariations:
Overall, while the trends (positives and negatives, relative strengths of coefficients) remains the same comparing our data to the original regressions, it is clear that the difficulty reproducing the datasets has created significant differences in the models presented. Overall, our standard deviations are significantly higher than in the original regressions. Without clear values to compare our control variables to, it is impossible to judge the efficacy of our controls relative to the overall models (which might have allowed us to determine where our data was most and least accurate compared to Han’s). However, the statistical significances of our main regressors are more or less consistent with the models presented in the paper, so compared to the data we were working with, it was a relatively successful recreation.
Graph Results

  Our graph shows similar trends in immigrant mobility by skin tone as Han’s graph in terms of the steepness of the slope across time periods; dark-skinned immigrants face steeper downward mobility and slower eventual upward mobility upon arrival compared to light-skinned immigrants. We couldn’t determine exactly how he grouped the skin tone values into light, medium and dark, so we took an educated guess.
We categorized light skin as 0-3, medium as 4-7, and dark skin as 8-10. In our graph what differs is at job 3 there is projected to be a similar ISEI score for light and dark skinned people. Just like his graph we see all immigrants undergo a downward mobility from their job abroad (1) to their first job in the US (2). In his graph it shows that at job 3 there would be a similar outcome for medium and dark skinned people. In our data dark skinned people get a better 3rd job more rapidly than light and medium skin do.
